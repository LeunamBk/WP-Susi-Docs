# WP-Susi-Docs

Wordpress plugin/widget for the management of protocols from SUSIS intern meetings. This component serves as a central data storage for SUSIS protocols. It accepts files in the odt format (all previous created files were converted in this format). The content of these files is stored as html in the databse. These documents could be aggregated over the webfrontend by time, and context and are also searchable.
